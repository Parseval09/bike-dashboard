# Bike Sharing Dashboard ðŸ›´

An interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize trends in bike-sharing data. This dashboard allows users to filter data, view descriptive statistics, and visualize bike rental trends across seasons, hours of the day, and weather conditions.

## Project Overview

This project based on [bike-sharing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset) from kaggle. The dataset contains various weather-related and time-based columns to help analyze how different factors affect bike rentals.

The dashboard is built using **Streamlit** to provide an interactive experience where users can explore the data through filters and various visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Filtering:** Filter the dataset by seasons and hours of the day.
- **Data Summary:** Display descriptive statistics of weather-related and rental data.
- **Weather Analysis:** Group by weather conditions and visualize their effect on bike rentals.
- **Season and Hour Trends:** Display trends of bike rentals across seasons and hours of the day.
